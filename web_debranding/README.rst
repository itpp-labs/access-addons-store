Enterprise users notice
=======================

* `Terms of Odoo Enterprise Subscription Agreement <https://www.odoo.com/documentation/user/9.0/legal/terms/enterprise.html#customer-obligations>`_ don't allow to disable server requests to odoo.com. For this reason feature #11 doesn't work in Enterprise version.
