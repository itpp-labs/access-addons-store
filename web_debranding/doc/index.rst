Auto-debrand new databases
==========================

To automatically install this module for every new databases set 'auto_install': True in ``__manifest__.py`` files of following modules:

* ``web_debranding``

* ``access_apps``
* ``access_settings_menu``
* ``mail (built-in)``

Also, it's recommended to add ``web_debranding`` to `server wide modules <https://odoo-development.readthedocs.io/en/latest/admin/server_wide_modules.html>`__, e.g.::

    ./odoo-bin --load=base,web,web_debranding
Usage
=====
* Open *Backend*
* Perform usual workflow

RESULT: No more reference to `Odoo <https://www.odoo.com/>`__. *Possible exceptions may be Mails.*

Examples
========

* Search a random string at the menu ``[[ Settings ]] >> Users & Companies >> Companies``

    Create and manage the companies that will be managed by **Odoo** from here. Shops or subsidiaries can be created and maintained from here.

* Try to delete Administrator via menu ``[[ Settings ]] >> Users & Copanies >> Users``

    You can not remove the admin user as it is used internally for resources created by *Odoo** (updates, module installation, ...).

  Note: You may see another error depending on installed modules.

* When you create new company it shows placeholder for field **Website**

    e.g. www.odoo.com

* Open menu ``[[ Settings ]] >> General Settings``.

    Use external pads in **Odoo** Notes.

    Extract and analyze **Odoo** data from Google Spreadsheet.

* Open menu ``[[ Discuss ]] >> CHANNELS >> #general``

  * Send ``/help`` to the chat

    **OdooBot** - now

    You can mention someone by typing @username, this will grab its attention.

    You can mention a channel by typing #channel.

    You can execute a command by typing /command.

    You can insert canned responses in your message by typing :shortcut.

* Open two browser tabs with Odoo. Then logout in one of it. Open any menu in another one.
