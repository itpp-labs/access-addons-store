 Multi-Brand Access Rules
==========================

Allows to use new variables to be used in ``domain_force`` field of Record Rules (``ir.rule``):

* ``website_ids`` -- equal to ``context["allowed_website_ids"]`` (see module ``web_website``)
* ``websites`` -- browsed ``website_ids``

For your information: Odoo provides ``website`` variable, which is equal to current website in frontend and is empty in backend

Example of usage:

* Show a blog on specific websites only (TODO: add link to the module)
* Show an event on specific websites only (TODO: add link to the module)
* Show a product on specific websites only (TODO: add link to the module)

Roadmap
